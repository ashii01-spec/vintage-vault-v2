Assignment Specification
Assessment Requirements:
You need to submit the following via LMS:
 • A zip file containing your code (the database, the PHP theme files(if used), the PHP files and
     the database for PHP).
 • You need to attend a 10-minute demonstration.
 • The Github link to your project
 • The Hosted Link

Scenario

This coursework will focus on continuing the development of your SaaS application from SSP1, now using the
Laravel 12 Framework.

Assume that your system is being migrated from its legacy PHP implementation into a modern Laravel-based
application. You are required to identify which core requirements from SSP1 can be carried over, and which
parts need to be refactored, extended, or newly created in Laravel.

You must demonstrate an understanding of the core features of server-side applications, including:

   •   Security and data protection

   •   Encryption and secure storage of sensitive information

   •   Token-based authentication and authorization (e.g., Sanctum or Passport)

   •   Usage of APIs to expose data endpoints for integration or consumption

You will then apply this knowledge to expand your own SaaS application. This should include both:

   1. A Laravel implementation of the SSP1 system’s core features (CRUD, authentication, landing page).

   2. Additional Laravel-based functionality such as API routes, middleware, role management, or
      integrations that demonstrate scalability.



Task
You are required to build a web application using Laravel 12, SQL, and Tailwind that meet the
requirements stated in the table below.

Submission and Assessment

    •   Submission is via LMS. A zipped copy of your code (not a RAR file) should be submitted immediately
        following your demonstration.

    •   Submission will not be accepted by alternative means (such as email), so you should ensure your
        submission is made well before the deadline to avoid last-minute problems.

    •   There will be a scheduled demonstration slot for you to show your work. Failure to demonstrate the
        system during your allocated time slot will automatically give you zero marks regardless of whether
        the work has been submitted.

    •   The database you choose to build the application on must be based on SQL. If SQLite is used, the DB
        file must be attached; if MySQL is used, an SQL dump must be attached to the ZIP submission file.
        If you do need to include a NoSQL database as well, screenshots of your node collections should be
        included in the submission file under a folder labeled “NoSQL DB Nodes Collections.”



Optional Marks

The marking scheme details 2 components that are optional, the use of a API and the ability to host your
application. These 2 can be completed at your own discretion, as these topics will not be covered during
lecture hours. You can use the below resources to learn more about these 2 topics.

Do note, the resources below require an active Linkdlin learning account to use.
